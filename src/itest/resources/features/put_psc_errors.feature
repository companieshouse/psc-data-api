Feature: Error and Retry Psc Data Requests

  Scenario Outline: Put psc statement when Mongo is not available
    Given Psc data api service is running
    And the database is down
    When I send a PUT request with payload "<data>" file for company number "<companyNumber>" with notification id  "<notificationId>"
    Then I should receive 503 status code
    And the CHS Kafka API service is not invoked

    Examples:
      | data         | companyNumber | notificationId              |
      | put_psc_data | 34777772      | ZfTs9WeeqpXTqf6dc6FZ4C0H0ZZ |

    When I send a PUT request with payload "<data>" file for company number "<companyNumber>" with notification id  "<notificationId>"

    And the CHS Kafka API service is not invoked

    Examples:
      | data                 | companyNumber | notificationId              |
      | put_psc_invalid_data | 34777772      | ZfTs9WeeqpXTqf6dc6FZ4C0H0ZZ |
